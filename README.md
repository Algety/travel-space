# To the Moon and Back Trips

This website is designed for a fictional travel company, Travel Moon LTD, based 123 Moon Road, Space City, Solar System. It aims to engage more customers and boost sales for their exclusive trips to the Moon. The site contains a booking form to easily reserve a trip, a Traveller`s Guide page where visitors can explore detailed information about the trips, including accommodations, food options, and luggage policies, a reviews section showcasing testimonials from customers. 
There’s also a contact section for potential customers to get in touch with Travel Moon LTD for any queries or additional information.

### Color: 
To create a visually appealing and accessible website, two main colors with strong contrast were used — dark blue, associated with technology, space, and activity, and white, which together create a dynamic appearance for the site.

### Font:

The fonts used for this website are Gobold High Bold Italic for the logo, and supporting the logo style, for headings, and Navbar links; and Oswald for plain text and sub-headings. Both fonts are backed up with the Sans-Serif font family in case there are any issues with the imported fonts

### Images:

Images in nearly similar color scheme, giving the feeling of exitement, positive emotions, sci-fi, where picked from free image stock websites.
